From its beginnings at the start of the 19th Century, the pharmaceutical industry is now one of the most profitable and influential in existence, attracting praise and controversy. Drug discovery is the process by which drugs are discovered and/or designed. In the past most drugs have been discovered either by identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by serendipitous discovery. A newer approach has been to understand how disease and infection are controlled at the molecular and physiology level and to target specific entities based on this knowledge. New technologies and Data Management/Informatics systems are now employed to speed up this process. Drug development is considered a costly and intensive process.
